This folder contains test where the results of complexes are analyzed. This is
helpful because some things cannot be tested by unit-tests. For example the
statistical proberties of integration algorithms are best tested here.

As a side effect this folder will contain a lot of examples how to use complexes
and how to analyse the results.
